- Separates **technical** and **behavioural** questions
- Logic-based generation (no API needed)
- Lightweight and fast
- Great for HR and evaluation teams

intern_profile = {
    "name": "Ali",
    "role": "Data Science Intern",
    "skills": ["Python", "Pandas", "Basic Machine Learning", "Data Visualisation"],
    "soft_skills": ["Communication", "Teamwork"]
}
